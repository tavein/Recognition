机器认知
=======

Nowadays Machine Learning is becoming much more popular with the public and researchers,
which used to make me bothered a lot because of enormous "名词党" and "调包侠" are arising.
However, now I have realized that I should try applying ml to the real life to
make a change about the life style of human beings, on the flip side, I think logging
some interesting projects might make it easier to show my abilities.

一些垃圾话

.. code:: PlainText

  总之，我大一时写Matlab达到的境界，绝大部分数模上的成功人士一辈子也达不到。
  现在虽然不写Matlab了，但是比起大一时强个几百倍还是没问题的。
  这不影响我是失败人士，过不了数模（这次过不算，实际上不该过的）。
